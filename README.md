# KLinInfo
Visual Linux utility to collect various system information, developed for KDE 3.3 environment (using KDevelop) on Slackware using QT 3.3 libraries. It was tested on Slackware 10, but should be possible to port on newer Slackware versions and other Linux distributions, if necessary. 

This program was created for gathering all the available information from this Linux system and using it to generate HTML files as reports. It has a simple interface and is very easy to use. It can give information on fonts, memory and disk usage, module and package information, as well as on many other issues. It can also be used as notepad for command or system files - it has an ability to store system or log file list or command list with their descriptions in separate files. There is also a posibility for using a script to retrieve more info (note, that this is a bash shell script so you should be using bash; otherwise you may have to adapt this script to your shell).

It can be compiled and installed as typical Linux utility. Initially, do a _configure_,  the _make_ and finally _make install_.

This is an old project, developed during my study times, and is not further developed, tested or supported.
